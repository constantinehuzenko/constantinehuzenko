*I started this page with one thought: "please don't write another boring description, it's not a CV - be creative!🙏🏻". After checking out other creative profiles (for inspiration, of course😂), I decided to invert my GitHub profile to my Wikipedia page😱. In my opinion, it is a suitable format to demonstrate who I am as a person, as well as a fun way to get to know me better as your potential coworker.*

**If you need to quickly understand my background as an Engineer, my experience and capacities, I would suggest you learn my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/konstantyn-husenko/) profile and request my CV (or huzenko.c@gmail.com). It would be great to hear from you!😎**
